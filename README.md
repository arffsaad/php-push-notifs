# PHP Push Notifications
Basic Browser Notifications made using with PHP. I made this as while learning about making Push Notifications on Browsers.

- Setting up is simple, use your preferred WebServer (XAMPP, Laragon, WAMP or anything) and navigate to index.php.
- You must allow notifications or the notifications will not be shown. (Some browsers require HTTPS for this to work).
- Import the SQL file to build the database, and make sure the PDO parameters (in notificationsHelper.php) match your Database setup.

Purpose:
I made this as a checkpoint for me to refer this in the future in case i need to use it again.
